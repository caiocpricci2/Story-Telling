This is Greg, a penguin, who lives in the south pole like almost every other penguin in the world.
And like most penguins, Greg is part of a big penguin community. The place where they live is very cold, so the large penguin waddle needs to stick together to survive.
But the cold doesn’t keep him from having fun. Greg has lots of friends to play with.
Eventually Greg grows up, and become the leader of the most famous penguin-boy-band in whole Antarctica.
But Greg’s party days were about to end. He had just seen the most beautiful penguin in the whole world.
Her name was Sara, and she was the Antarctic champion of penguin sliding race. She had won the last five penguin world cups.
And Greg and Sara had amazing times together. From great summer holidays on the beach…
To amazing glacier views on winter.
And eventually, the inevitable happened and a baby penguin was due! Both Sara and Greg were very happy with the good news. And while Greg kept the egg warm…
Sara was taking care of the food.
Soon the new baby Earl was born, bringing joy and delight to the family.
And now it’s Earl’s turn, to play, dance, sing, slide, find love, and enjoy his penguin life to the maximum. But that’s a whole new story…
